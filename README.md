# Target Sistemas - Coding Challenge Solutions

This repository contains the solutions for a series of exercises from a coding challenge at **Target Sistemas**. The project consists of five JavaScript files, each containing a solution for one of the tasks. These exercises were designed to test problem-solving and programming skills, focusing on basic algorithms and logic.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `exercicio1.js`: Contains the solution for Exercise 1.
- `exercicio2.js`: Contains the solution for Exercise 2.
- `exercicio3.js`: Contains the solution for Exercise 3.
- `exercicio4.js`: Contains the solution for Exercise 4.
- `exercicio5.js`: Contains the solution for Exercise 5.

Each file includes the problem statement along with the implemented solution.
